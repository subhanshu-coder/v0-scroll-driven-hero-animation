### What is GitHub?
Online service to store Git repositories and collaborate.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "GitHub Pages says the site isn't ready"
- Wait 2-5 minutes
- Verify settings (Settings → Pages)
- Check repository is PUBLIC

### "Can't push to GitHub"
- Make sure you added the remote:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin [your-url]
  ```
- Use personal access token (not password)

### "Animations don't work"
- Check console (press F12)
- Test locally: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Verify GSAP CDN is loading

### "File not found errors"
- Use relative paths: `./file.html`
- Not absolute: `/file.html`
- Check capitalization

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use a proper terminal, not file explorer**
   - Windows: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Mac: Use Terminal
   - Linux: Any terminal works

2. **Make your repository PUBLIC**
   - GitHub Pages only works with public repos
   - You can make sensitive data private with .gitignore

3. **Use clear commit messages**
   - Bad: `git commit -m "update"`
   - Good: `git commit -m "Add scroll animation"`

4. **Test before you push**
   - Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000
   - Check for errors (F12)

5. **Keep documents for reference**
   - Bookmark this folder
   - Keep README.md in your repo
   - Use docs when you're unsure

6. **Commit often**
   - Don't make huge changes
   - Commit frequently
   - Makes history cleaner
